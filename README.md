# html-resume
Hello,

I am transitioning my career from a health services backround into being a Software Engineer. I completed a 6 month Software Engineer bootcamp with Ada Developers Academy followed by a 5 month Software Engineer Internship with Nintendo. Now I am working on a Web Developers Bootcamp certificate while I search for my next opportunity.

Here is my resume created in HTML.

Thanks! Shweet Abraha
