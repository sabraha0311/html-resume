    <h2>Summary</h2>
    <p>
      I am transitioning my career from a health services backround into being a
      Software Engineer. I completed a 6 month Software Engineer bootcamp with
      Ada Developers Academy followed by a 5 month Software Engineer Internship
      with Nintendo. Now I am working on a Web Developers Bootcamp certificate
      while I search for my next opportunity.
